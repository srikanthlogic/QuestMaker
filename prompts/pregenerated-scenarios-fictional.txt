# Game Context

# Your Task
Your task is to generate {numScenarios} unique, fictional scenarios for this location.

# Scenario Requirements
Each scenario must contain:
1.  A "title" (LocalizedString object).
2.  A "description" (LocalizedString object).
3.  An array of exactly two "choices", each with "text" (LocalizedString object) and an "outcome".
4.  Each "outcome" must have an "explanation" (LocalizedString object) and an array of "resourceChanges".
5.  Each "resourceChange" must have a "name" (a lowercase English string from the resource list) and a "value" (integer).

# Output Format
The final output MUST be a valid JSON object with a single root key "scenarios" containing an array of the {numScenarios} generated scenario objects.
